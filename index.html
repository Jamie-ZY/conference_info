    <h2>Conference Overview</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The 2024 International Conference of Social Computing (ICSC 2024) will be held at the Hong Kong University of Science and
        Technology (Guangzhou) from August 30 to 31, 2024. The conference is jointly organized by the Urban Governance and Design
        Thrust (UGOD) of the Society Hub at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) and the National Laboratory
        for Computational Social Science and Governance at Tsinghua University. The theme of the conference is "AI, Human and Cities." 
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
       Social Computing emerged from the significant advancements in complex evolutionary research facilitated by big data and artificial
        intelligence methodologies. It encompasses a range of techniques, from dynamic modeling, computer simulation, and complex network 
        analysis to the construction of predictive models using machine learning and deep learning algorithms, the application of explainable 
        AI to uncover theoretical insights, and the use of various algorithms to measure variables and validate theoretical models.
        The integration of these methods with big data and social science theories has given rise to a new field: Social Computing.
        Social Computing revolves around two core concepts: computation and sociality, which mutually promote and inspire each other. 
        On the one hand, Social Computing focuses on how social research can contribute to computational research, such as social software design 
        and social network recommendation algorithms. On the other hand, it explores how computational research can enhance social research,
        examining the developments brought about by the introduction of new data and methods into social science research.    
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The International Conference on Social Computing (ICSC) originated in 2016 from the "Network Analysis of Online Behavior Chicago-Tsinghua Conference" 
        jointly organized by the Social Network Research Center at Tsinghua University and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. 
        In 2017, the conference hosted the annual meeting of the International Network for Social Network Analysis (SUNBELT) while also incorporating
        an online behavior agenda. In 2018, it was officially renamed the first International Conference of Social Computing and established the English 
        journal Journal of Social Computing (JoSoCo), expanding the original academic circle centered on online behavior and complex network analysis.
        It brought together a group of domestic and international scholars interested in Social Computing, organizing annual conferences, establishing 
        its own journal, and occasionally hosting lectures and providing training opportunities to broaden the influence of the domestic and international 
        Social Computing field. Since then, the conference has been held annually (with one year canceled due to the pandemic).
